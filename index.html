      <h2>Command line weather</h2>
	  <p><b><code>cloudburst</code></b> is the result of some slacking off and learning new things along the way.</p>
	  <p>What isn't uploaded to github (Yet) are a TON of Markdown notes stored in a VimWiki on how to do alot of things. These notes are what helped me try to integrate what I've learned over the past few months into a practical mnemonic resource of vital information.</p>
	  <p>Over time, I found myself using Vim more than VSCode and IntelliJ. The nuances of using Regular Expression and trying to transform information quickly and with minimal effort became more of an interest than using some clunky graphic user interface.</p>
	  <p>In the text-base environment I felt more at home. Like it was learning how to play the piano as opposed to using a drum machine. Sure, it's cool, but it's no fun if there is no creativity and imagination at work.</p>
	  <p>Command line programs will always have a place in the heart of any computer programmer devoted to their work.  It's the difference between writing a book and directing a movie based upon a book where a lot of stuff get's cut out.</p>
	  <p>In that same spirit, made this program to include many features. Mostly stupid tricks but the important ones do a ton of cool stuff.</p>
	  <p>A better documentation of cloudburst can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jrcharney/cloudburst">its Github page</a>. Some of that content will eventually make its way to this page.</p>
	  <p>Cloudburst provides the data that <a href="https://jrcharney.github.io/Blitz">Blitz</a> needs to function. Think of Blitz as the Christian de Neuvillette to Cloudburt's Cyrano de Bergerac. One project is the pretty face but the brains and the heart of this project is this side of the project.</p>

	  <h2>Things to add</h2>
	  <ul class="todolist">
		<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;<b><abbr type="Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report">METAR</a> Support</b> - See if we can get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR">METAR</a> data. (I'd at least like to create a <code>.json</code> file to decrypt METAR data.)</li>
		<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;<b><abbr type="Common Alerting Protocol">CAP</abbr> Support</b> - Is it worth adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol">CAP</a>?</li>
		<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;<b>A better stylesheet than Blitz</b> - Blitz has got this sorta ungly cyan thing going at the moment. I want Cloudburst to have a little more of a violet flare to it.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Tide Calculator</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Moon phases/moon rise/moon set</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Eclipse finder (solar and lunar)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Earthquake summary (See what's shaking within a specific radius)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Sunrise and Sunset for other days and locations</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Better time zone support and date/time input</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;METAR style output (single line)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;EAS Protocol support (Better warnings, at least in North America.)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Better support for metric.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Tsunami/Volcano check</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;COLORS!</li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;NOAA Weather Radio Database using JSON. (See <a href="doc/ccl.md">CCL</a>) </li>
<li><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;Some cool <a href="http://www.figlet.org/">figlet</a> and/or <a href="https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/">boxes</a> logo</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most of that will be command line and scraping the web.</p>
